# Task Management App

A desktop cross-platform (Mac and Windows) application built with Qt and C++ that allows users to create, update, and manage personal or team tasks efficiently.  
Developed as part of a university project to explore GUI design, OOP, and data persistence.

- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Save and load tasks from JSON or CSV repositories
- Filter tasks by name, status using Specification Design Pattern (with AND and OR logic)
- Responsive Qt-based user interface

## Technologies Used
- C++ (OOP, STL, smart pointers)
- Qt Framework
- JSON/CSV for data storage

## How to Run
1. Open the project in your prefered C++ IDE (tested with Qt 6.x).
2. Configure a **Desktop Kit** for C++ (e.g., MinGW or MSVC).
3. Build and run the project directly from the IDE.
